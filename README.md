# Purpose
This exercise combines webscraping, flask, pymongo, and html bootstraping to create a web application. 
# Scraping
The scraping uses Python's beautiful soup to parse web pages into HTML text. This text is then filtered / searched to find the relevant informatoin
# Bootstrap Formatting
The base style used to build the webpage is bootstrap. This creates a grid system to overlay and place the web components into.

## Bootstrap Changes
The only two "official" bootstrap changes were made to the website.

1. The button in the Jumbotro header was chagned to green.![Button](./resources/button.PNG)
2. The images were changed to thumbnails.![Thumbnail](./resources/thumbnail.PNG)

All other changes such as background colors and text colors were made using the html style command. Colors are a hard coded in bootstrap and style is needed to overwrite the default bootstrap values.
